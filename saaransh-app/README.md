# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Project Saaransh: AI-Powered E-Consultation Feedback Analysis

## About The Project

The eConsultation module on the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MoCA) website is a vital platform for public participation in the legislative process. It allows stakeholders to submit comments and suggestions on draft legislation. However, a high volume of submissions presents a significant challenge, creating a risk that valuable feedback may be inadvertently overlooked or inadequately analyzed.

**Project Saaransh** is an AI-powered solution designed to automate and enhance the analysis of comments received through this module. The project aims to equip MoCA officials with intelligent tools to systematically process, categorize, and understand stakeholder feedback, ensuring every submission is given due consideration.

## Core Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to reduce the manual effort required to analyze feedback by providing deep, automated insights. This is achieved through three key features:

*  **Sentiment Analysis:** Automatically classify the sentiment of each comment (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral) to gauge the overall public opinion on specific provisions and the draft legislation as a whole.
*  **Summary Generation:** Generate accurate, concise summaries of lengthy comments to capture their core meaning without requiring a full manual review.
*  **Word Cloud Visualization:** Create a dynamic word cloud from all submissions to visually represent the most frequently used keywords and highlight key areas of public focus.

## Key Features

* **Automated Sentiment Scoring:** Analyze comments individually and provide an aggregate sentiment score for the entire draft legislation.
* **Extractive & Abstractive Summarization:** Employ advanced NLP models to generate meaningful summaries that preserve the original context.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface to view overall statistics, filter comments by sentiment, and explore the word cloud.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Built to efficiently handle thousands of comments submitted during the consultation period.

## Technology Stack (Proposed)

* **Backend:** Python (Flask / FastAPI)
* **NLP/ML Libraries:** Hugging Face Transformers, NLTK, spaCy, Scikit-learn
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Frontend/Dashboard:** Streamlit / Dash / React
* **Database:** PostgreSQL / SQLite

## Expected Outcome

Project Saaransh will empower the Ministry to:
* **Save significant time and resources** in the feedback analysis process.
* **Ensure a comprehensive review** of all stakeholder comments, minimizing the risk of oversight.
* **Gain rapid, data-driven insights** into public sentiment and key concerns.
* **Improve the quality and transparency** of the legislative process by systematically incorporating public feedback.
